# Getting started app

This Getting Started app shows how to set up a direct (1:1) chat using Chat SDK and React. 

It comes with a pre-defined UI to showcase what the final product might look like.

This app is written using:

* [PubNub Chat SDK](https://github.com/pubnub/js-chat)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (v5.0.2)
* [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/versions/) (v18.2.0)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (v4.3.9)

## Prerequisites

To run the Getting Started app, make sure to have the following:

* [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)(>=1.22.19)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)(>=18.10.0)
* Code Editor (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
* PubNub [Publish & Subscribe keys](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/basics/initialize-pubnub) that you can obtain from [Admin Portal](https://admin.pubnub.com/) after setting up an [account](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/setup/account-setup). The autogenerated **Demo Keyset** in **My First App** on the Admin Portal already contains the configuration required to complete this guide (enabled **App Context** and selected region).

## Usage

* Direct (1:1) [channel creation](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/chat/chat-sdk/build/features/channels/create)
* [User creation](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/chat/chat-sdk/build/features/users/create).
* [Sending and receiving](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/chat/chat-sdk/build/features/messages/send-receive) messages.
