# PubNub JavaScript Chat SDK

Chat SDK offers a set of handy methods to create your own feature-rich chat or add a chat to your existing application.

## Supported platforms

Chat SDK is written in TypeScript and relies on the existing [JavaScript SDK](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript).

It's framework-agnostic and lets you build a client- or server-side chat app using any JavaScript-based framework, like:

- React
- React Native
- Vue
- Angular
- Nest or Express

## Features

Chat SDK offers a wide range of features to build direct, group, and public chats.
