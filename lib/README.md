# PubNub JavaScript Chat SDK

Chat SDK offers a set of handy methods to create your own feature-rich chat or add a chat to your existing application.

## Supported frameworks

Chat SDK is written in TypeScript and relies on the existing [JavaScript SDK](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript). It's framework-agnostic and lets you build a chat app using any JavaScript-based framework, like:

- React
- React Native
- Vue
- Angular

## Features

Chat SDK offers a wide range of features to build direct, group, and public chats.
